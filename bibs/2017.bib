abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: The amount of information available in textual format is rapidly increasing in the biomedical domain. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) applications are becoming increasingly important to facilitate the retrieval and analysis of these data. Computing the semantic similarity between sentences is an important component in many NLP tasks including text retrieval and summarization. A number of approaches have been proposed for semantic sentence similarity estimation for generic English. However, our experiments showed that such approaches do not effectively cover biomedical knowledge and produce poor results for biomedical text. Methods: We propose several approaches for sentence-level semantic similarity computation in the biomedical domain, including string similarity measures and measures based on the distributed vector representations of sentences learned in an unsupervised manner from a large biomedical corpus. In addition, ontology-based approaches are presented that utilize general and domain-specific ontologies. Finally, a supervised regression based model is developed that effectively combines the different similarity computation metrics. A benchmark data set consisting of 100 sentence pairs from the biomedical literature is manually annotated by five human experts and used for evaluating the proposed methods. Results: The experiments showed that the supervised semantic sentence similarity computation approach obtained the best performance (0.836 correlation with gold standard human annotations) and improved over the state-of-the-art domain-independent systems up to 42.6{\%} in terms of the Pearson correlation metric.},

abstract = {Citation details: Aydın,F., H{\"{u}}s{\"{u}}nbeyi,Z.M., and € Ozg{\"{u}}r,A. Automatic query generation using word embeddings for retrieving passages describing experimental methods. Abstract Information regarding the physical interactions among proteins is crucial, since protein– protein interactions (PPIs) are central for many biological processes. The experimental techniques used to verify PPIs are vital for characterizing and assessing the reliability of the identified PPIs. A lot of information about PPIs and the experimental methods are only available in the text of the scientific publications that report them. In this study, we approach the problem of identifying passages with experimental methods for physical interactions between proteins as an information retrieval search task. The baseline sys-tem is based on query matching, where the queries are generated by utilizing the names (including synonyms) of the experimental methods in the Proteomics Standard Initiative–Molecular Interactions (PSI-MI) ontology. We propose two methods, where the baseline queries are expanded by including additional relevant terms. The first method is a supervised approach, where the most salient terms for each experimental method are obtained by using the term frequency–relevance frequency (tf.rf) metric over 13 art-icles from our manually annotated data set of 30 full text articles, which is made publicly available. On the other hand, the second method is an unsupervised approach, where the queries for each experimental method are expanded by using the word embeddings of the names of the experimental methods in the PSI-MI ontology. The word embeddings are obtained by utilizing a large unlabeled full text corpus. The proposed methods are evaluated on the test set consisting of 17 articles. Both methods obtain higher recall scores compared with the baseline, with a loss in precision. Besides higher recall, the word embeddings based approach achieves higher F-measure than the baseline and the tf.rf based methods. We also show that incorporating gene name and interaction key-word identification leads to improved precision and F-measure scores for all three eval-uated methods. The tf.rf based approach was developed as part of our participation in the Collaborative Biocurator Assistant Task of the BioCreative V challenge assessment, whereas the word embeddings based approach is a novel contribution of this article.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathogenic Escherichia coli infections cause various diseases in humans and many animal species. However, with extensive E. coli vaccine research, we are still unable to fully protect ourselves against E. coli infections. To more rational development of effective and safe E. coli vaccine, it is important to better understand E. coli vaccine-associated gene interaction networks. METHODS In this study, we first extended the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to semantically represent various E. coli vaccines and genes used in the vaccine development. We also normalized E. coli gene names compiled from the annotations of various E. coli strains using a pan-genome-based annotation strategy. The Interaction Network Ontology (INO) includes a hierarchy of various interaction-related keywords useful for literature mining. Using VO, INO, and normalized E. coli gene names, we applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to mine all PubMed abstracts and retrieve E. coli vaccine-associated E. coli gene interactions. Four centrality metrics (i.e., degree, eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness) were calculated for identifying highly ranked genes and interaction types. RESULTS Using vaccine-related PubMed abstracts, our study identified 11,350 sentences that contain 88 unique INO interactions types and 1,781 unique E. coli genes. Each sentence contained at least one interaction type and two unique E. coli genes. An E. coli gene interaction network of genes and INO interaction types was created. From this big network, a sub-network consisting of 5 E. coli vaccine genes, including carA, carB, fimH, fepA, and vat, and 62 other E. coli genes, and 25 INO interaction types was identified. While many interaction types represent direct interactions between two indicated genes, our study has also shown that many of these retrieved interaction types are indirect in that the two genes participated in the specified interaction process in a required but indirect process. Our centrality analysis of these gene interaction networks identified top ranked E. coli genes and 6 INO interaction types (e.g., regulation and gene expression). CONCLUSIONS Vaccine-related E. coli gene-gene interaction network was constructed using ontology-based literature mining strategy, which identified important E. coli vaccine genes and their interactions with other genes through specific interaction types.},

abstract = {Drug labels contain detailed information about the drugs including their safety concerns which are regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are adverse reactions associated with a specific drug. Automatic extraction of ADRs could help FDA greatly regulate drug safety. In this study, we employed an integrated approach of machine learning (ML)-based and dictionary-/rule-based methods to recognize ADR terms and normalize these terms to MedDRA Preferred Terms. The machine learning approach was used for the identification of the entities and is based on a recently proposed deep learning architecture. The model includes bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Alternatively, a dictionary-and rule-based approach was also used to identify ADR terms. MedDRA terms were added as a dictionary to SciMiner, our in-house text-mining system, and multiple rules for term expansion and exclusion to increase coverage and accuracy were implemented. The best performance was achieved using a combined approach: ADRs were first identified by the ML-based approach and then normalized to MedDRA Preferred Terms by the dictionary-and rule-based approach. Our system achieved 76.97{\%} F1 score on the entity detection task and 82.58{\%} micro-averaged F1 score on the ADR normalization task in the TAC 2017 ADR challenge.},

abstract = {There is a big amount of published articles in the biomedical domain. Automatically processing and extracting biologically crucial information such as protein-protein interactions from the biomedical literature is one of the main difficulties for both research and commercial platforms. We contributed to the Document Triage Task of the Precision Medicine Track of the BioCreative VI challenge assessment by developing text mining methods to assist health professionals and researchers. We build three methods, which are capable of receiving a list of PMIDs and returning a relevance-ranked judgement for the articles in order to identify relevant PubMed articles, which are about genetic mutations affecting protein-protein interactions. Our first approach is based on meaning calculation, which computes the words' meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is based on the Helmholtz principle and has been utilized for various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval, text classification, and text summarization. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, our effort is the first work, which uses meaning calculation of the terms retrieved from the Interaction Network Ontology (INO) to construct a semantic classifier. Our second approach depends on the extraction of the most salient terms, generated from Genia Tagger 1 , taking advantages of the term frequency-relevance frequency (TF-RF) metric. This methodology also uses sprinkling, which is a process of adding further terms corresponding to class labels of documents to the training documents in order to strengthen class-based relationships in the training phase. Our third approach is based on using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In our model, the first layer embeds words into low-dimensional vectors. Convolutions over the embedded word vectors are performed in the next layer by using multiple filter sizes. The next stage is max-pooling the result of the convolutional layer into a long feature vector. Finally, the results are classified with the softmax layer. In order to evaluate our results, we also implemented linear kernel with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB) as the baseline algorithms. According to the experiment results the presented methods outperform the baseline algorithms.},
