abstract = {Sentiments of words differ from one corpus to another. Inducing general sentiment lexicons for languages and using them cannot, in general, produce meaningful results for different domains. In this paper, we combine contextual and supervised information with the general semantic representations of words occurring in the dictionary. Contexts of words help us capture the domain-specific information and supervised scores of words are indicative of the polarities of those words. When we combine supervised features of words with the features extracted from their dictionary definitions, we observe an increase in the success rates. We try out the combinations of contextual, supervised, and dictionary-based approaches, and generate original vectors. We also combine the word2vec approach with hand-crafted features. We induce domain-specific sentimental vectors for two corpora, which are the movie domain and the Twitter datasets in Turkish. When we thereafter generate document vectors and employ the support vector machines method utilising those vectors, our approaches perform better than the baseline studies for Turkish with a significant margin. We evaluated our models on two English corpora as well and these also outperformed the word2vec approach. It shows that our approaches are cross-lingual and cross-domain.},

abstract = {As the access to information in the education domain increases, new technologies are developing for school children. However, deaf and dumb children still have limited access to the information, especially in their school lives. One of the most important reasons for this problem is the lack of studies in the Sign Language domain. In this paper, we propose a novel method for translation from Turkish to Turkish Sign Language for primary school students using the statistical machine translation approach. To the best of our approach, this is the first work that applies statistical translation to Turkish Sign Language. A parallel corpus is compiled from the books published by Ministry of National Education of Turkey. The results of the system were tested using different evaluation metrics. We observe that the results obtained are motivating for new studies. {\textcopyright} 2019 IEEE.},

abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a wide range of applications. Recently, word embedding based systems that does not rely on hand-crafted features dominate the task as in the case of many other sequence labeling tasks in NLP. However, we are also observing the emergence of hybrid models that make use of hand crafted features through data augmentation to improve performance of such NLP systems. Such hybrid systems are especially important for less resourced languages such as Turkish as deep learning models require a large dataset to achieve good performance. In this paper, we first give a detailed analysis of the effect of various syntactic, semantic and orthographic features on NER for Turkish. We also improve the performance of the best feature based models for Turkish using additional features. We believe that our results will guide the research in this area and help making use of the key features for data augmentation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the current version of two different treebanks, the re-annotation of the Turkish PUD Treebank and the first annotation of the Turkish National Corpus Universal Dependency (henceforth TNC-UD). The annotation of both treebanks, the Turkish PUD Treebank and TNC-UD, was carried out based on the decisions concerning linguistic adequacy of re-annotation of the Turkish IMST-UD Treebank (T{\"{u}}rk et. al., forthcoming). Both of the treebanks were annotated with the same annotation process and morphological and syntactic analyses. The TNC-UD is planned to have 10,000 sentences. In this paper, we will present the first 500 sentences along with the annotation PUD Treebank. Moreover, this paper also offers the parsing results of a graph-based neural parser on the previous and re-annotated PUD, as well as the TNC-UD. In light of the comparisons, even though we observe a slight decrease in the attachment scores of the Turkish PUD treebank, we demonstrate that the annotation of the TNC-UD improves the parsing accuracy of Turkish. In addition to the treebanks, we have also constructed a custom annotation software with advanced filtering and morphological editing options. Both the treebanks, including a full edit-history and the annotation guidelines, and the custom software are publicly available under an open license online.},

abstract = {Motivation: Prediction of the interaction affinity between proteins and compounds is a major challenge in the drug discovery process. WideDTA is a deep-learning based prediction model that employs chemical and biological textual sequence information to predict binding affinity. Results: WideDTA uses four text-based information sources, namely the protein sequence, ligand SMILES, protein domains and motifs, and maximum common substructure words to predict binding affinity. WideDTA outperformed one of the state of the art deep learning methods for drug-target binding affinity prediction, DeepDTA on the KIBA dataset with a statistical significance. This indicates that the word-based sequence representation adapted by WideDTA is a promising alternative to the character-based sequence representation approach in deep learning models for binding affinity prediction, such as the one used in DeepDTA. In addition, the results showed that, given the protein sequence and ligand SMILES, the inclusion of protein domain and motif information as well as ligand maximum common substructure words do not provide additional useful information for the deep learning model. Interestingly, however, using only domain and motif information to represent proteins achieved similar performance to using the full protein sequence, suggesting that important binding relevant information is contained within the protein motifs and domains.},

@article{Karadeniz2019,
abstract = {Although there is an enormous number of textual resources in the biomedical domain, currently, manually curated resources cover only a small part of the existing knowledge. The vast majority of these information is in unstructured form which contain nonstandard naming conventions. The task of named entity recognition, which is the identification of entity names from text, is not adequate without a standardization step. Linking each identified entity mention in text to an ontology/dictionary concept is an essential task to make sense of the identified entities. This paper presents an unsupervised approach for the linking of named entities to concepts in an ontology/dictionary. We propose an approach for the normalization of biomedical entities through an ontology/dictionary by using word embeddings to represent semantic spaces, and a syntactic parser to give higher weight to the most informative word in the named entity mentions. We applied the proposed method to two different normalization tasks: the normalization of bacteria biotope entities through the Onto-Biotope ontology and the normalization of adverse drug reaction entities through the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The proposed method achieved a precision score of 65.9{\%}, which is 2.9 percentage points above the state-of-the-art result on the BioNLP Shared Task 2016 Bacteria Biotope test data and a macro-averaged precision score of 68.7{\%} on the Text Analysis Conference 2017 Adverse Drug Reaction test data. The core contribution of this paper is a syntax-based way of combining the individual word vectors to form vectors for the named entity mentions and ontology concepts, which can then be used to measure the similarity between them. The proposed approach is unsupervised and does not require labeled data, making it easily applicable to different domains.},

Yet, most of the recent models proposed on joint learning require a dataset that is annotated jointly for all the tasks involved. Such datasets are available only for frequently used languages. In this paper, we propose a novel BiLSTM CRF based joint learning model for dependency parsing and named entity recognition tasks, which has not been employed before for Turkish to the best of our knowledge. This enables joint learning of various tasks for languages that have limited amount of annotated datasets. Our model, tested on a frequently used NER dataset for Turkish, has comparable results with the state-of-the-art systems. We also show that our proposed model out performs the joint learning model which uses a single dataset.},

abstract = {The Precision Medicine Initiative is a multicenter effort aiming at formulating personalized treatments leveraging on individual patient data (clinical, genome sequence and functional genomic data) together with the information in large knowledge bases (KBs) that integrate genome annotation, disease association studies, electronic health records and other data types. The biomedical literature provides a rich foundation for populating these KBs, reporting genetic and molecular interactions that provide the scaffold for the cellular regulatory systems and detailing the influence of genetic variants in these interactions. The goal of BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track was to extract this particular type of information and was organized in two tasks: (i) document triage task, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction task, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task. When comparing the text-mining system predictions with human annotations, for the triage task, the best F-score was 69.06{\%}, the best precision was 62.89{\%}, the best recall was 98.0{\%} and the best average precision was 72.5{\%}. For the relation extraction task, when taking homologous genes into account, the best F-score was 37.73{\%}, the best precision was 46.5{\%} and the best recall was 54.1{\%}. Submitted systems explored a wide range of methods, from traditional rule-based, statistical and machine learning systems to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Given the level of participation and the individual team results we find the precision medicine track to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community. In the meantime, the track produced a manually annotated corpus of 5509 PubMed documents developed by BioGRID curators and relevant for precision medicine. The data set is freely available to the community, and the specific interactions have been integrated into the BioGRID data set. In addition, this challenge provided the first results of automatically identifying PubMed articles that describe PPI affected by mutations, as well as extracting the affected relations from those articles. Still, much progress is needed for computer-assisted precision medicine text mining to become mainstream. Future work should focus on addressing the remaining technical challenges and incorporating the practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world precision medicine information-related curation.},

We have used the CNN news dataset which only contains the text parts of news as basis and we have augmented the dataset by collecting the images of the news articles. We generated two class ground truth for the image and sentences of news by using Tf-Idf and Word2Vec vectors cosine and SEMILAR sentence-to-sentence similarity methods, respectively.
