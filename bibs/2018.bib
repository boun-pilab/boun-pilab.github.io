To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one that employs the bidirectional LSTM-CRF model for VMWE identification. Furthermore , the gappy 1-level tagging scheme is used for discontiguity and overlaps.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that linguistic features of a word such as possession, genitive or other grammatical cases can be employed in word representations of a named entity recognition (NER) tagger to improve the performance for morphologically rich languages. However, these taggers require external morphological disambiguation (MD) tools to function which are hard to obtain or non-existent for many languages. In this work, we propose a model which alleviates the need for such disambiguators by jointly learning NER and MD taggers in languages for which one can provide a list of candidate morphological analyses. We show that this can be done independent of the morphological annotation schemes, which differ among languages. Our experiments employing three different model architectures that join these two tasks show that joint learning improves NER performance. Furthermore, the morphological disambiguator's performance is shown to be competitive.},

abstract = {Identification of high affinity drug-target interactions (DTI) is a major research question in drug discovery. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to predict drug-target binding affinity using only ligand SMILES information. We represent proteins using the word-embeddings of the SMILES representations of their strong binding ligands. Each SMILES is represented in the form of a set of chemical words and a protein is described by the set of chemical words with the highest Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) value. We then utilize the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm to predict protein - drug binding affinities in the Davis and KIBA Kinase datasets. We also compared the performance of SMILES representation with the recently proposed DeepSMILES representation and found that using DeepSMILES yields better performance in the prediction task. Using only SMILESVec, which is a strictly string based representation of the proteins based on their interacting ligands, we were able to predict drug-target binding affinity as well as or better than the KronRLS or SimBoost models that utilize protein sequence.},

abstract = {This paper describes a question answering framework that can answer student questions given in natural language. We suggest a methodology that makes use of reliable resources only, provides the answer in the form of a multi-document summary for both factoid and open-ended questions, and produces an answer also from foreign resources by translating into the native language. The resources are compiled using a question database in the selected domains based on reliability and coverage metrics. A question is parsed using a dependency parser, important parts are extracted by rule-based and statistical methods, the question is converted into a representation, and a query is built. Documents relevant to the query are retrieved from the set of resources. The documents are summarized and the answers to the question together with other relevant information about the topic of the question are shown to the user. A summary answer from the foreign resources is also built by the translation of the input question and the retrieved documents. The proposed approach was applied to the Turkish language and it was tested with several experiments and a pilot study. The experiments have shown that the summaries returned include the answer for about 50–60 percent of the questions. The data bank built for factoid and open-ended questions in the two domains covered is made publicly available.},

@article{Hur2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), also called as drug adverse events (AEs), are reported in the FDA drug labels; however, it is a big challenge to properly retrieve and analyze the ADRs and their potential relationships from textual data. Previously, we identified and ontologically modeled over 240 drugs that can induce peripheral neuropathy through mining public drug-related databases and drug labels. However, the ADR mechanisms of these drugs are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to develop an ontology-based literature mining system to identify ADRs from drug labels and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). RESULTS We developed and applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to mine ADRs from the drug labels provided in the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2017, which included drug labels for 53 neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs). We identified an average of 243 ADRs per NID and constructed an ADR-ADR network, which consists of 29 ADR nodes and 149 edges, including only those ADR-ADR pairs found in at least 50{\%} of NIDs. Comparison to the ADR-ADR network of non-NIDs revealed that the ADRs such as pruritus, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, nervousness, asthenia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia were highly enriched in the NID network. Our ChEBI-based ontology analysis identified three benzimidazole NIDs (i.e., lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole), which were associated with 43 ADRs. Based on ontology-based drug class effect definition, the benzimidazole drug group has a drug class effect on all of these 43 ADRs. Many of these 43 ADRs also exist in the enriched NID ADR network. Our Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) classification further found that these 43 benzimidazole-related ADRs were distributed in many systems, primarily in behavioral and neurological, digestive, skin, and immune systems. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that ontology-based literature mining and network analysis can efficiently identify and study specific group of drugs and their associated ADRs. Furthermore, our analysis of drug class effects identified 3 benzimidazole drugs sharing 43 ADRs, leading to new hypothesis generation and possible mechanism understanding of drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.},

@article{Ozturk2018,
abstract = {Motivation The effective representation of proteins is a crucial task that directly affects the performance of many bioinformatics problems. Related proteins usually bind to similar ligands. Chemical characteristics of ligands are known to capture the functional and mechanistic properties of proteins suggesting that a ligand-based approach can be utilized in protein representation. In this study, we propose SMILESVec, a Simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES)-based method to represent ligands and a novel method to compute similarity of proteins by describing them based on their ligands. The proteins are defined utilizing the word-embeddings of the SMILES strings of their ligands. The performance of the proposed protein description method is evaluated in protein clustering task using TransClust and MCL algorithms. Two other protein representation methods that utilize protein sequence, Basic local alignment tool and ProtVec, and two compound fingerprint-based protein representation methods are compared. Results We showed that ligand-based protein representation, which uses only SMILES strings of the ligands that proteins bind to, performs as well as protein sequence-based representation methods in protein clustering. The results suggest that ligand-based protein description can be an alternative to the traditional sequence or structure-based representation of proteins and this novel approach can be applied to different bioinformatics problems such as prediction of new protein-ligand interactions and protein function annotation.

abstract = {Originated as a label to mark specific tweets, hashtags are increasingly used to convey messages that people like to see in the trending hashtags list. Complex noun phrases and even sentences can be turned into a hashtag. Breaking hashtags into their words is a challenging task due to the irregular and compact nature of the language used in Twitter. In this study, we investigate feature‐based machine learning and language model (LM)‐based approaches for hashtag segmentation. Our results show that LM alone is not successful at segmenting nontrivial hashtags. However, when the N‐best LM‐based segmentations are incorporated as features into the feature‐based approach, along with context‐based features proposed in this study, state‐of‐the‐art results in hashtag segmentation are achieved. In addition, we provide an analysis of over two million distinct hashtags, autosegmented by using our best configuration. The analysis reveals that half of all 60 million hashtag occurrences contain multiple words and 80{\%} of sentiment is trapped inside multiword hashtags, justifying the need for hashtag segmentation. Furthermore, we analyze the grammatical structure of hashtags by parsing them and observe that 77{\%} of the hashtags are noun‐based, whereas 11.9{\%} are verb‐based.},
